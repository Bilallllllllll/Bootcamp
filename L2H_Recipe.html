        <li>185g dark chocolate</li>
        <li>85g plain floer</li>
        <li>40g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>50g white chocolate</li>
        <li>50g milk chocolate</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>375g golden caster sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl.<br> Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.</li> <br>

        <li>Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water,<br> then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan,<br> not touching the water. Put over a low<br> heat until the butter and chocolate have melted,<br> stirring occasionally to mix them.</li> <br>

        <li>Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively,<br> cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes<br> on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.</li> <br>

        <li>While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position<br> a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C<br> fan/gas 4.</li> <br>

        <li>Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking<br> parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa<br> powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake<br> the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.</li> <br>

        <li>Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.</li> <br>

        <li>Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar.<br> With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar.<br> They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake.<Br> This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is.<br> You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about<Br> double its original volume. Another check is to turn off<br> the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side.<br> If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail<br> on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.</li> <br>

        <li>Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently<br> fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side,<br> take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle.<br> Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving <br>the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until<br> the two mixtures are one and the colour<br> is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking<br> out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.</li> <br>

        <li>Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift<br> the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side,<br> to cover the top evenly.</li> <br>

        <li>Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before.<br> The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising,<br> but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking<br> gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you<br> don’t want to overdo this mixing.</li> <br>

        <li>Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.</li> <br>

        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with<br> the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and<br> paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.</li> <br>

        <li>Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes,<br> open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the<br> tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done,<br> so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top<br> has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come<br> away from the tin. Take out of the oven.</li> <br>

        <li>Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the<br> brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut<br> brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the<br> brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares.</li> <br>

        <li>They’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for<br> up to a month.</li> <br>
    </ol>
