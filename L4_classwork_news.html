        <p> <span class="bold">WOW.</span></p>

        <p>A BIG political moment.</p>

        <p>For something that wasn't even technically a Budget, it was one heck of a statement of intent from the new prime minister and new chancellor.</p>

        <p>And it is a gamble.</p>

        <p>A massive leap in a new direction.</p>

        <p>It amounts to the wholesale shredding of previous economic policy: both the ones adopted by Conservative governments over the last 12 years (which Liz Truss sat within for most of that time) and those of Labour before that.</p>

        <p>It is an all-or-nothing strategy, where the prime minister will own the consequences, good or bad.</p>

        <p>Economic growth is the prize they seek.</p>

        <p>But they can't be certain their approach will work, nor the methods they have chosen to deliver it will be popular.
        </p>

        <p>
            And then there are the side effects.

    <div>
        <p>The markets are jittery. The value of the pound is slumping and the cost of government borrowing is rising, just when the government has said it going to borrow a shedload more money.</p>

        <p>A few around here with a taste for political history have been making comparisons with the so-called 'Barber boom'.
        </p>

        <p>A senior Labour figure was the first to mention it to me just as Kwasi Kwarteng prepared to get to his feet in the Commons.
        </p>

        <p>And a few hours later, so did Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p>

        <p>The Barber boom is a reference to the stint in the Treasury of former Conservative chancellor Anthony Barber, when Ted Heath was prime minister.</p>

        <p>Mr Barber cut taxes big time, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/1573242663771447296">particularly in 1972</a> - it being the only Budget in the last half century to cut taxes more than Kwasi Kwarteng just has.</p>

        <p>Mr Barber wanted a "dash for growth". He borrowed money, cut taxes and the economy grew.</p>

        <p>But strikes, unemployment and inflation followed, and the Conservatives lost the next general election.</p>

        <p>Things are different now: unemployment is low, the Bank of England controls interest rates.</p>

        <p>But don't be surprised if we hear more of Mr Barber's stewardship of the economy in the coming months, particularly from those sceptical about Mr Kwarteng's plans.</p>

        <p>So, given the risks, and the historical precedent, why is the government choosing this approach?</p>

        <p>They argue this is a calculated and worthwhile thing to do, because to do nothing, to maintain the status quo, would be a bigger gamble still.</p>

        <p>And yes, growth has been sluggish for years and years, and the economy teeters on the edge of - or is perhaps already in - recession.</p>

        <p>So few would dispute doing something to catalyse the economy, one way or another.</p>

        <p>They do, though, have a big persuasion job on their hands, including, incidentally, among some on their own side.

            </ul>
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>There is a bunch of Conservative MPs who have never warmed to Liz Truss, and some who are hostile towards her political instincts.</p>

        <p>One or two have already said as much publicly, others are keeping their thoughts to themselves for now.</p>

        <p>Some fret the plan doesn't look fair, given the scale of the tax cuts for the richest.</p>

        <p>Others see it as a sugar hit for the economy which runs the risk, they fear, of stoking inflation further.</p>

        <p>For others though, in the parliamentary party and among the grassroots, this is a moment they can gladly cheer: what they see as a properly Conservative budget after all those years of coalition compromise, Brexit and Covid.</p>

        <p>Which brings us to the coming political argument: the government hopes this set of measures will give the economy a giant injection of oomph.</p>

        <p>It will certainly give politics that: the dividing lines between the Conservatives, Labour and others are bold and star</p>
