<h1>My accomodation </h1>

<h2>University</h2>
    <p>I attend University in a city called Manchester, and this is my 5th year of being here.<br>
        During this time period I have lived in 5 differnt places. And I have to say that<br>
         my current accomodation is definitely the nicest, although I wouldn't necessarily say best.<br> 
         As other factors contribute towards that. The main factor being the people you live with.<br>
        And I have to admit that over the past few years I've been blessed to live with<br> 
        some amazing individuals.I currenlty live in a 2 bedroom flat with one other flat mate.<br>
        The flat consists of 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a store room and an open plan living area<br> 
        and ktichen.
